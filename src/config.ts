  aboutMe:
    "I'm Sarweshwar, also known as Sarweshero, a passionate Full Stack Developer with strong backend expertise and extensive experience in AI/ML technologies. I specialize in building robust, scalable applications using modern web technologies and have hands-on experience with machine learning frameworks including TensorFlow, PyTorch, Ultralytics, Transformers, and Hugging Face. My expertise spans across cloud platforms (Azure, AWS, Google Cloud), containerization with Docker, web servers like Nginx, and various databases including PostgreSQL, MongoDB, and MySQL. I've successfully contributed to building complete backend systems for production applications, including designing comprehensive database architectures and developing APIs for both web and mobile applications. I am actively engaged in hackathons—competing in over 15+ hackathons, reaching the finals in 3, and winning selection in 2.",
